# just playing around with the US Census API
# let's see if I can get data for Edgewood, MD
#           from https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/edgewoodcdpmaryland,US/PST045222

import requests
from sensitive import CENSUS_API_KEY

# using the poverty data API
# notes:
#   possible problem: the dates for the census data might not entirely overlap with attack surface dates

# SMALL_AREA_INCOME_POVERTY_BASE: str = 'http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/poverty/saipe/schdist'
#
# res = requests.get(url=SMALL_AREA_INCOME_POVERTY_BASE)
# print(res.json())
