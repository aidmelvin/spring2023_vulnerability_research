Aidan Melvin's Spring 2023 Vulnerability Research Code

The code that parsed attack surface data is in the `parser/` directory.

The code representing models of different things (such as states
and counties) can be found in the `models/` directory.

Final data analysis can be found in the `ml_algos/` directory.

Scripts to aggregate data from the various sources (including
the US Census API and attack surface dataset) are in `database_scripts/`.

Constants for various use are in `constants/`.

If there are any questions about this code or you want to see
the raw data (it has not been uploaded to Git because that would
be bad practice), feel free to contact me.
